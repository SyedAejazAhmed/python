# Palindrome Number Checker
This repository contains a simple Python script to check if a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

## How it Works
The script takes a number as input from the user and checks whether it is a palindrome. It does this by reversing the digits of the number and comparing the reversed number to the original number.

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyedAejazAhmed/python.git
