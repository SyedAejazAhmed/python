# Armstrong Number Checker
This repository contains a Python script to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

# Code Explanation

## The script checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number by following these steps:
1. Prompt the user to input a number.
2. Initialize variables to store the sum of powers of digits, a temporary copy of the input number, and the number of digits.
3. Calculate the number of digits in the input number.
4. Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits.
5. Compare the calculated sum with the original number to determine if it is an Armstrong number.

## How it Works
1. The user inputs a number.
2. The number of digits (n) in the input number is calculated.
3. The script computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of n.
4. he script checks if the computed sum is equal to the original number and prints the result.
